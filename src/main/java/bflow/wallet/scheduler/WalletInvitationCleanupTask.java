/**
 * Bulk-transitions PENDING wallet invitations past their expiration
 * date to EXPIRED.
 *
 * <p>Invitation status otherwise only advances lazily, when someone
 * tries to accept or reject an invitation after the fact (see
 * {@code ServiceWalletSharing#validatePendingInvitation}). An
 * invitation nobody ever touched stays PENDING in the database
 * forever, even though it's already well past its expiration date.
 * That stale PENDING status is read literally — not
 * expiration-aware — by two places:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the wallet member seat-limit check, which counts current
 *       members plus PENDING invitations as "occupied seats", so a
 *       long-expired invitation can keep counting against the
 *       plan's member limit indefinitely;</li>
 *   <li>the duplicate-pending-invite check, which blocks re-inviting
 *       an email that already has a PENDING row, even if that
 *       invitation expired weeks ago.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Running this every 15 minutes keeps that staleness window small
 * relative to the 7-day expiration period, without needing every
 * caller of "is this invitation still pending" to independently
 * account for expiration.
